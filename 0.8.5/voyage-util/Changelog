12 June 06
Added a subdirectory "experimental" which currently contains some
simple scripts to help update create a new Voyage flash card using
an existing Voyage flash card.  They look for files which differ
between the two systems, and create lists of things to be added and
to be deleted.  Note that (as the directory name implies) these are
not for the average user :-).

12 June 06
Added a (possibly temporary) script "make-initrd".  This is another
"work in progress", and still needs a lot of refinement.

05 June 06
Added the "work in progress" script "make-kernel".  This script will
do the kernel compilation, then automatically install the result
(bzImage and modules) into a voyage target directory.  Next step
will be to add in necessary stuff to make an initrd image to go with
the kernel.

17 May 06
Changed everything to require root permissions (see DeveloperNotes)
Did further work on copyfiles.sh / setboot.sh, which are now mostly
working ok.
Added the current working version of etc/voyage-profiles to this (svn)
respository.
Added a new routine "delete_config_var" to remove a config var from the
script environment (used in select-profile when the profile is changed)
Tested everything on my USB flash adapter, using both lilo and grub, and
it passed (but didn't try anything very complicated).

16 May 06
Continued work on copyfiles.sh.  Now basically running except for
bootstrap, which is not yet working correctly.
Added a warning message when voyage-install.sh is not run as root.
Put in Lilo and Grub routines into setboot.sh, and started work to
fix minor problems.  Not yet complete.
Added a couple of routines (check_yn() and get_yn()) to script-utils.
Added a new script update-config.sh for routines which will be needed
in both voyage-install.sh and voyage-update.sh to update the target
configuration.

15 May 06
Added most (but not yet all) of the necessary code to copyfiles.sh.
Added file "exclude-files" to specify (to rsync) filenames or patterns
which should not be copied to the target.
Added file "DeveloperNotes" to keep track of things not yet completed
or problems not yet solved.

14 May 06
Added a routine "get_serial_speed" to script-utils.sh.
Added code to voyage-install.sh to assure it isn't run "standalone"
Added routines select_target_disk, select_target_boot, select_target_console
and confirm_copy_details.  Everything should now be ready to write the
actual copy and installation of bootstrap loader.

14 May 06
Moved all the files over to "subversion" on the bbrack.org server

13 May 06
Added a "driver" script (voyage.update) to get things started.  This script
exports script-utils.sh and select-profile.sh, then executes either
voyage-install.sh or voyage-update.sh to do the rest of the work.
Removed the prolog (getting current directory, sourcing utility scripts) from
all scripts except voyage.update.
Cleaned up select-profile.sh to make it suitable for either type of run.
Renamed the routine "ask_distrib_dir" to be "ask_work_dir" and enhanced it
to make it useful for either type of run.  Moved the routine out of
voyage-install.sh into script-utils.sh.

4 May 06
Enhanced handling of configuration variables, both those stored locally
(.voyage.install.conf) and those to be stored on the target system
(/etc/voyage.conf).  Modified the routines read_config and write_config
so they could handle both files.
voyage-setup.sh is not used at this time.
Added a description of the handling of config vars "ConfNotes"
Modified the profiles to include quotes around the VOYAGE_PROFILE if
needed.

3 May 06
Added 'VOYAGE_PROFILE={string}' to each profile in etc/voyage-profiles
Started on a new script "select-profile.sh"

1 May 06
Changed main script to be "voyage-install.sh".  Changed voyage-setup.sh
to source the variables from etc/voyage-profiles which correspond to the
selected module.
Re-wrote list_ix to do a simple scan of the list rather than screw around
with arrays (originally it didn't work when I tried to use it)
