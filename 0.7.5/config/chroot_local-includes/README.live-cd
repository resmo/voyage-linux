==============================================================================

This README.live-cd provide information on how to install Voyage Linux from the 
Live CD.

==============================================================================
Installing Voyage Linux to a hard disk from Live CD 
==============================================================================

Afte booting the Live CD, login as root (password: voyage) 

1. Create distribution directory for installation
	
	# mkdir /tmp/root
	# mount -o loop /live/image/live/filesystem.squashfs  /tmp/root
	# cd /tmp/root
	
2. Make a mount point for installation disk

	# mkdir /tmp/cf

3. Format target disk device

	# /usr/local/sbin/format-cf.sh /dev/hda    
	
This will create /dev/hda1 ext2 partition on /dev/hda disk device. 
** Note that this operation is very dangerous since it will erase your disk! 
   Make sure what you are doing and must do it right!
   
4. Start voyage.update installation script
	
	# /usr/local/sbin/voyage.update

Following the instruction to select /tmp/root as distribution directory, and 
/tmp/cf as mount point.  After the installation complete, simple reboot the
board and Voyage will be started!

There are some additional packages installed for PXE and NFS server.  After
starting Voyage, you can safely remove them by:

	# remountrw
	# apt-get remove syslinux atftpd nfs-kernel-server \
                     bzip2 sg3-utils minicom

After all, remove the last line in /etc/dnsmasq.more.conf:
	conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq.pxe.conf


==============================================================================
Installing to a Thumb-drive or Disk-constraint system (net4826)
==============================================================================

Follow the instruction to install Voyage Linux to a ext2 partition with root 
squashfs filesystem like the Live CD format.  This is done by extlinux.  

1. As usual, create mount point for the installation disk and format it 

    # mkdir /tmp/cf
    # /usr/local/sbin/format-cf.sh /dev/hda 

This will create /dev/hda1 ext2 partition on /dev/hda disk device. 
** Note that this operation is very dangerous since it will erase your disk! 
   Make sure what you are doing and must do it right!
   
2. Mount the disk and copy CD content to disk device
    
    # mount /dev/hda1 /tmp/cf
    # rsync -aHx /live/image/* /tmp/cf
	
3. Create extlinux.conf and install extlinux 
    
    # cp /tmp/cf/isolinux/isolinux.cfg /tmp/cf/isolinux/extlinux.conf
    # extlinux -i /tmp/cf/isolinux 
	
4. Update master boot record for disk device
    
    # cat /usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin > /dev/hda
	
After all, reboot!  

There are some notes when using this installation method:

a. You will have a read-only squashfs root filesystem on a CF that consumes 
   just 36MB and you cannot modify the rootfs.
b. By default, all changes made to the system reside on tmpfs.  i.e. Changes 
   are lost after reboot.  You can preserve the changes by creating another 
   partition and labeled it as "casper-rw", or create a loopback file called 
   "casper-rw" at / 
   (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDPersistence: this is not tested 
   and need more exploration)
c. You will still be able to boot Live CD again after the installation.  But 
   once the CD is booted, the installed disk with be mounted as rootfs and you 
   are unable to umount it.  To get around this, you need to specify the 
   following command at boot prompt (assume CD-ROM device is /dev/hdc):
   
   		linux bootfrom=/dev/hdc
