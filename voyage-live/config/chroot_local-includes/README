1. Introduction
======================
Voyage Linux is Debian derived distribution that is best run on a x86 embedded 
platforms such as PC Engines ALIX/WRAP, Soekris 45xx/48xx and Atom-based boards.

It can also run on low-end x86 PC platforms. Typical installation requires 
128MB disk space, although larger storage allows more packages to be installed.
Voyage Linux is so small that it is best suitable for running a full-feature 
firewall, wireless access point, Asterisk/VoIP gateway, music player or network 
storage device. 

Currently, Voyage Linux has the following editions:

    * Voyage Linux - the basic version
    * Voyage MPD - Music Player Daemon
    * Voyage ONE - VoIP software - Asterisk, dahdi etc

All editions are delivered as distribution tarball and Live CD in i386 
architecture. AMD64 architecture is available for Voyage Linux only. We also 
offer SDK to ease customizing Voyage Linux. 

For more information about Voyage Linux, please visit:
	http://linux.voyage.hk
	
2. Installation
======================
Download the Voyage Linux software package from 
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/voyage/ 
to a Linux machine.

extract the software tarball:
	tar --numeric-owner -jxf voyage-<version>.tar.bz2
	
as root, run the installation script:
	cd voyage-<version>
	./usr/local/sbin/voyage.update
	
Before you run the installer you may have to format the disk device.  Assuming 
Compact Flash device on /dev/sda.
	fdisk /dev/sda
	mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda1
	tune2fs -c 0 /dev/sda1

To save more spaces for not having reserved filesystem block, you may also run:
    tune2fs -r 0 -c 0 /dev/sda1

There is a helper script in ./usr/local/sbin/format-cf.sh to ease formatting
and creation of ext2 file system.  Use it at your own risk!
	./usr/local/sbin/format-cf.sh /dev/sda
	
Voyage Linux now requires at least 128MB storage to run.  However, more disk 
space is recommended if you want to add more software and be able to run 
"apt-get upgrade".

voyage.update scripts will ask you a couple of questions to complete the 
installation:

	1 - Create new Voyage Linux disk
	2 - Update existing Voyage configuration
	3 - Exit

Press 1 to install voyage to disk device.  After all, you will be prompted to 
the main installation menu.  You should go through the menu item 1 - 6 in 
sequence.

	1 - Specify Distribution Directory
	2 - Select Target Profile
	3 - Select Target Disk
	4 - Select Target Bootstrap Loader
	5 - Configure Target Console
	6 - Copy Distribution to Target
	7 - Exit
  
It will take a short while (1-5 min.) to copy all files from software package to 
disk device.  The above configuration will be saved to .voyage.config.  If you 
run voyage.update next time, it will use same configuration as default.

Once Voyage Linux is booted up, you will be prompted for login.  The default
root password is "voyage", please change the root password after first login.

	# remountrw
	# passwd

3. Configuration
======================

3.1 Network Interface
======================
By default, eth0 requests IP address using DHCP. 

In /etc/network/interfaces,

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto br0
iface br0 inet dhcp
        bridge_ports eth0 eth1

This will create a bridge interface br0 with eth0 and eth1 as slave.

For wireless device configuration, edit /etc/network/interface and have
the follow interface configuration section:

# for nl80211 driver (e.g. ath5k, ath9k, p54pci)
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
       address 10.1.10.1
       netmask 255.255.255.0
       broadcast 10.1.10.255
       hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.wlan0.conf
       up nat.sh wlan0 eth0 "10.1.10.0/24"

Also see below for hostapd configuration:

# for hostap driver (Prism 2.5)
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
        address 10.1.10.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        broadcast 10.1.10.255
        up iwconfig wlan0 essid voyage mode Master
        up nat.sh wlan0 eth0 "10.1.10.0/24"
        
Both enable wlan0 device as wireless interface in a separate network and the
wireless interface runs in NAT mode.

A friendly script, nat.sh, is located in /usr/local/sbin/, generates all 
necessary iptables rules for NAT'ing interface. nat.sh is now integrated to 
work with nocat.  Syntax:
	nat.sh <nat device> <output device> <network address>
	
	<nat device> - a tag to identify the NAT interface, no need to be a real 
		device name, but should be unqiue if multiple NAT devices are 
		configured
	<output device> - the outbound device name for NAT
	<network address> - the IP network with mask for NAT

3.2 Hostapd
======================
Assume you have nl80211 compatible wireless driver, e.g. ath5k, ath9k, p54pci, 
and want to setup a wireless access points where wireless client are in a NAT 
network.  Add the following lines in /etc/network/interfaces:

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
        address 10.1.10.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        broadcast 10.1.10.255
        hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.wlan0.conf
        up nat.sh wlan0 eth0 "10.1.10.0/24"
        
This assumes you wireless device is wlan0 and the above will setup wlan0 
interface with IP address 10.1.10.1 assigned and all traffics are NAT'd to eth0.
All wireless clients connected to this access point will be assigned with IP 
range 10.1.10.0/24.

Then create a file /etc/hostapd/hostapd.wlan0.conf:

interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
logger_syslog=-1
logger_syslog_level=2
logger_stdout=-1
logger_stdout_level=2
debug=4
#dump_file=/tmp/hostapd.dump
#ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd
#ctrl_interface_group=0
channel=6
hw_mode=g
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=3
eapol_key_index_workaround=0
eap_server=0
wpa=3
ssid=voyage-wpa
wpa_passphrase=voyage-wpa
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
eapol_version=1

The above configuration will setup both WPA and WPA2.  To setup WPA2 only, 
set "wpa=2".  The wireless AP service name (ESSID) will be "voyage-wpa" with 
passphrase "voyage-wpa".  Change ssid, wpa_passphrase and channel values if 
desirable.

Then run: 
# ifup wlan0

to activate the wireless access point now.  The above setting also 
automatically enables wireless access point after reboot.

3.3 wpa-supplicant
======================

If you run nl80211 compatible wireless driver, e.g. ath5k, ath9k, p54pci, 
and want to connect to an existing wireless access point or router in your 
network, update with the following lines in /etc/network/interfaces:

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
        wpa-driver wext
        wpa-ssid <your ssid>
        wpa-psk <your WPA shared key>
        wpa-key-mgmt WPA-PSK
        wpa-pairwise TKIP
        wpa-group TKIP
        wpa-proto WPA
        wireless-mode Managed

Replace <your ssid> to the SSID and <your WPA shared key> to WPA shared key of 
your wireless access point / router. If you use WPA2 in your wireless network, 
you need to change wpa-proto to "RSN".  You also need to change 
wpa-pairwise and wpa-group to "CCMP TKIP" as well.
Then run: 
# ifup wlan0

to connect to the wireless access point / router now.  The above settings also
automatically connect to wireless access point / router after reboot.

3.4 Bridging
======================
To setup a bridge br0 with slave device eth0 and wlan0, add the following in
/etc/network/interface

auto br0
iface br0 inet dhcp
        bridge_ports eth0 wlan0

The wlan0 device (for AP functionality) setup will be slightly different:

auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet manual

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
    hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.wlan0.conf

Then run:

# ifup br0 

to activate the wireless bridge device.

3.5 DHCP/DNS - dnsmasq
======================
DHCP support from dnsmasq is now enabled by default. 

Edit /etc/dnsmasq.more.conf and there are following lines:

dhcp-leasefile=/var/tmp/dnsmasq.leases
dhcp-range=wlan0,10.1.10.10,10.1.10.250,24h
dhcp-range=eth1,10.1.20.10,10.1.20.250,24h
dhcp-range=eth2,10.1.30.10,10.1.30.250,24h
dhcp-range=eth3,10.1.40.10,10.1.40.250,24h

dnsmasq will provide IP address lease 10.1.10.10-250, 10.1.20.10-250, 
10.1.30.10-250, 10.1.40.10-250.

Comment out all the lines in /etc/dnsmasq.more.conf to disable DHCP in dnsmasq.

3.6 LED Support
======================
Voyage kernel >= 2.6.23 (from Voyage 0.5) comes with LED driver for WRAP, ALIX 
and Soekris 48xx boards.

To enable LED control, simply load the corresponding kernel module
	# modprobe leds-alix (for ALIX)
	# modprobe leds-wrap (for WRAP)
	# modprobe leds-net48xx (for Soekris 48xx)

LED could then be controlled in /sys/class/leds/<device>:#. For example,

To turn on LED on ALIX:
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/brightness
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/brightness
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/brightness

To turn off LED:
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/brightness
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/brightness
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/brightness

There are more interesting feature for LED control, first load the following 
LED trigger modules:
	# modprobe ledtrig-heartbeat
	# modprobe ledtrig-timer

1. enable LED1 for heartbeat trigger - higher the load, faster it blinks
	# echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/trigger

2. enable LED2 to show ide disk activity
	# echo ide-disk > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/trigger

3. enable LED3 for net device, on eth0 for link, send and receive
	echo netdev > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/trigger
	echo eth0 > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/device_name
   	echo "link tx rx" > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/mode

4. enable LED3 for timer-based control, 1 sec on, 5 sec off
	# echo timer > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/trigger
	# echo 1000 >  /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/delay_on
	# echo 5000 >  /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/delay_off

to turn off trigger
	# echo none > /sys/class/leds/alix\:1/trigger
	# echo none > /sys/class/leds/alix\:2/trigger
	# echo none > /sys/class/leds/alix\:3/trigger 
	
From 0.5.1, if ALIX and WRAP install profile is selected, heartbeat and ide-disk 
driver will be automatically enabled at boot. To disable this feature, edit
/etc/default/voyage-util and update VOYAGE_LED variable to "NO":
	VOYAGE_LEDS="NO"

Known Issues:
On ALIX3D3, LEDS may not work properly, you need to add

leds-alix2.force=1 

in the kernel boot parameter (i.e. /boot/grub/menu.lst).  This is because
ALIX3D3 is with different BIOS version than ALIX3D2.
	
3.7 voyage-sync script
=======================

Starting from 0.6, the legacy /ro and /rw directories will be replaced by
voyage-sync script, which is located under /etc/init.d/.  At boot, /var/tmp
and /var/log are by default mounted under tmpfs.  All the changes will be 
synchronized back to disk at shutdown. To sync back to disk manually while 
running, run:

# remountrw
# /etc/init.d/voyage-sync sync
# remountro

If you want to add more directories to tmpfs, modify VOYAGE_SYNC_DIRS in 
/etc/default/voyage-util.  

For more information on the usage, please read /etc/default/voyage-util.


4. Board-specific Notes
=======================
Please note that some of the information in this section are obsoleted (FIXME).

4.1 ALIX support
======================

4.1.1 Temperature sensors for ALIX.1 and ALIX2/3
================================================
When running Voyage Linux with ALIX, choose ALIX profile in voyage update,
the required modules would be added to /etc/modules.  It adds the following 
modules in /etc/modules:
	w83627hf 
	lm90
	geodewdt
	
ALIX.1 board uses w83627hf driver while ALIX.2/3 uses lm90.  You can get the 
temperature reading from sensors program, or get the values from sysfs:

(for ALIX.1)
	cat /sys/devices/platform/w83627hf.656/temp1_input
	cat /sys/devices/platform/w83627hf.656/temp2_input
	cat /sys/devices/platform/w83627hf.656/temp3_input


You may also use sensors utility to get the temperature reading.  If temp1 
reading may not be ready at boot up, you need to modify w83627hf section in 
/etc/sensors.conf:

chip "w83782d-*" "w83627hf-*"
...
	set sensor1 1
	
Known Issue: the readings returned from w83627hf is not very accurate.  temp1 
reading is too low (~30C) and some offset should be applied.  But temp1 reading 
can move down to 20C if you apply cooling agent on the Geode processor.  temp2 
and temp3 do not move up or down too much at idle or under high low.

(for ALIX.2/3)
	cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-004c/temp1_input
	cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-004c/temp2_input
	

4.2 WRAP support
======================

4.2.1 Watchdog for WRAP
=======================
For WRAP board, wd1100 has been ported to kernel 2.6.  If you choose WRAP
option in voyage.update, wd1100 driver will be added to /etc/module.  

To load wd1100 to kernel, run the following commands:

	modprobe wd1100
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/wd/graceful
	echo 30 > /proc/sys/dev/wd/timeout
or
	modprobe wd1100 sysctl_wd_graceful=0 sysctl_wd_timeout=30

This will set timeout value to 30 seconds.  

You will have to restart watchdog userland program to activate watchdog timer
	/etc/init.d/watchdog restart

In addition, you will need to make sure that /etc/watchdog.conf is properly 
configured.  For above watchdog module configuration for WRAP, the following 
settings should do:

watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog
interval	    = 15

And make sure the watchdog device is available:
	
	mknod -m 600 /dev/watchdog c 10 130

You may also add the following line to /etc/modules to enable loading wd1100 
driver at startup: 
	
	wd1100 sysctl_wd_graceful=0 sysctl_wd_timeout=30

To test watchdog module, you can try to stop the watchdog userland program.
	/etc/init.d/watchdog stop
The hardware will restart after 30 seconds at most.

4.2.2 Temperature sensors for WRAP
==================================
If you choose WRAP in voyage.update, the required modules would be added
to /etc/modules.  It adds the following modules in /etc/modules:
	scx200_acb base=0x810,0x820
	lm77

You will find a new driver in /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/lm77/.  To read the 
temperature, 
	cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/1-0048/temp1_input

Divide the temps by 1000 you will get the temperature reading in Celcius.  
Unfortunately, the temperature reading can not be retrieved using "sensors" util.

Please note that latest WRAP2D/E does not host lm77 sensor anymore.
------------------------------------------
If you are using commodity hardware other than WRAP, the easiest way would be 
installing lm-sensors package by
	
	apt-get install lm-sensors
	
and then run sensors-detect

5. General Issues
======================

  How can I add a program:
	- use "apt-get install <program>" of course

  How can I add a file or install a program from sources (without using apt-get)
  so it comes up every time I boot:
	- /usr/local/sbin/remountrw to allow Read-Write
	- Move the file or the program to it's location in /ro
	- Symlink the file's original location to /rw
	- fastreboot

	EXAMPLE:
	You install "webmin" from sources, the miniserver is in /var/webmin 
	directory, configuration files are in /etc/webmin directory and the start on
	is in /etc/init.d/webmin :

	- move /var/webmin directory to /ro/var/webmin
	- symlink in the original /var to /rw//var/webmin
	- create a symlink in /etc/rcS.d/ to start automagically as last one at boot time

	#remountrw
	#mv /var/webmin /ro/var/webmin
	#ln -s /rw//var/webmin /var/webmin
	#ln -s /etc/init.d/webmin /etc/rcS.d/S56webmin
	#fastreboot

6. Support

	voyage-linux@list.voyage.hk 
	
The list archives can be viewed and searched at :
	http://list.voyage.hk/pipermail/voyage-linux/

6.2 Development
======================
Starting from 0.6.0, Voyage Linux is built by Debian Live.  You can find
the subversion repository for Debian Live config in:

http://svn.voyage.hk/repos/voyage/trunk/voyage-live

Getting start to build Voyage Linux under Debian r6.0 (squeeze) or Voyage SDK:
# apt-get install live-helper
# svn co http://svn.voyage.hk/repos/voyage/trunk/voyage-live voyage-live
# cd voyage-live
# ./build.sh iso 	<= this will build the Live CD
# ./build.sh tar 	<= this will build .tar.bz2 distro
# ./build.sh sdk 	<= this will build sdk Live CD

6.3 Known Issues
======================
- When using CF card for heavy write operation, the following settings on 
  pdflush should be applied (Recommended by PCEngines). 
    # echo 500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs
    # echo 1024000 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes
    # echo 100 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs 
  You can also put these files to /etc/sysctl.conf
    vm.dirty_expire_centisecs=500
    vm.dirty_bytes=1024000
    vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs=100 

- When installing from Voyage Linux amd64 Live CD to disk, grub installation may
  not work properly.  Please use lilo as bootloader instead.

- Older generation of VIA C3 processor may not be booted properly.

- Timezone files are removed to save space.  To restore it, run:
    apt-get install --reinstall tzdata

- If Voyage cannot boot complaining rootfs can't be located, tty to added the 
following to the kernel boot parameters:
	"ide=nodma all_generic_ide"
or try (on or after 0.6.5):
	"ide_core.nodma=0.0"

- Sometimes, grub boot screen may not appear after BIOS post if the boot
partition is too large (~4GB).  Creating a smaller boot partition (512MB) and 
install Voyage to it may solve this issue.

- There have been repeatedly reported problem for lilo installation problem
while voyage.update is installing lilo bootloader to the flash media.  This
problem should have be fixed in Voyage 0.5.  If you encounter a similar 
problem again, please report to voyage-linux mailing list.

- In case you encountered locale and dialog complain when installing package
via "apt-get install", you can carry out the following commands to get rid
of the error message:
	apt-get install dialog apt-utils

- There is a problem reported when installing voyage over usb device using ub 
kernel module.  Moreover, it is assumed that voyage is installed in /dev/hda1
of the target platform.  

6.4 Live CD and PXE boot
======================
Voyage Live CD is now available for every stable voyage release:
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/ISO/
	
Daily build Live CD is also available at:
	http://www.voyage.hk/download/ISO/voyage-current.iso

You can run the Live CD under VMWare for testing purpose.  In addition, it
can act as a installation CD and PXE boot server as well.

You can find README.live-cd and README.pxe from the root direcory of Live CD.

7.0 Unsupport or Deprecated Documentation
======================
This section documents deprecated documentation which is no longer supported.

7.1 NoCatSplash 
======================
NoCatSplash is included in Voyage Linux, but it is disabled by default.  Edit 
/etc/default/nocatsplash and set ENABLE="true" to enable it.  You will can start 
or stop NoCatSplash by 
	/etc/init.d/nocatsplash [start|stop]
	
Next, you will also need to edit /etc/nocat.conf to setup NoCatSplash properly.  
The most common way is to add the following lines at the end of /etc/nocat.conf:
ExternalDevice  eth0  
InternalDevice  wlan0
LocalNetwork    10.1.10.0/24

Make sure that wlan0 matches the LocalNetwork IP address, you should double-
check that from ifconfig.

7.2 NoCatAuth
======================
NoCatAuth is not included in Voyage Linux.  However, it can be installed by 
running:
	apt-get install nocatauth-gateway
	
Same as NoCatSplash, set ENABLE="true" in /etc/default/nocatauth-gateway to 
enable it in boot up.   Note that nocat.conf is located in 
/etc/nocatauth/gateway and the most common to configure nocatauth-gateway is 
appending the following to nocat.conf:

ExternalDevice  eth0  
InternalDevice  wlan0
LocalNetwork    10.1.10.0/24

You may also want to touch GatewayMode (default=Passive):
GatewayMode [Passive|Captive|Open]

It is better to un-install NoCatSplash by "apt-get remove nocatsplash" and 
"rm /etc/nocat.conf" explicitly to avoid confusion.

As nocatauth requires perl to run, you are required to have a larger disk space 
to run (probably 128MB).  Please also make sure that you can only run either 
NoCatSplash or NoCatAuth, not both.
